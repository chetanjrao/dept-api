# Document of architecture of API
## Project Structure
```
 src
  â”‚   app.js          # App entry point
  â””â”€â”€â”€api             # Express route controllers for all the endpoints of the app
  â””â”€â”€â”€config          # Environment variables and configuration related stuff
  â””â”€â”€â”€jobs            # Jobs definitions for agenda.js
  â””â”€â”€â”€loaders         # Split the startup process into modules
  â””â”€â”€â”€models          # Database models
  â””â”€â”€â”€services        # All the business logic is here
  â””â”€â”€â”€subscribers     # Event handlers for async task
```
